1. The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product can belong to only one category, but a category can have multiple products. This relationship is typically represented in a database schema by having a foreign key in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table.

2. To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint. This constraint will ensure that the value in the foreign key column (representing the category ID) in the "Product" table must exist in the "Product_Category" table.

3. **SQL Schema Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Product_Category (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Product (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    category_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Product_Category(category_id)
);
```

In this schema, the "Product" table has a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column, which references the "category_id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that each product in the "Product" table is assigned a valid category from the "Product_Category" table.ï¿¼Enter
